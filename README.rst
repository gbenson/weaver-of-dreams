Weaver of Dreams
================

*Weaver of Dreams* will be a single-page application where you can
draw on a weaving draft and see changes in real time.  I don't
especially need this, I'm mainly writing it to level up my JavaScript
and figure out what I need to be able to write basic psuedo apps for
my phone and Chromebook.

Notes:

* The code may or may not be deployed at https://gbenson.net/wod/app/

* `How to Read a Weaving Draft`_ might be useful if if you don't know
  what any of this is
